Hello and welcome to my page!

Here you can find my thesis, Stochastic model identification and model metrics with deep learning applications.

In the files you will see the codes used in every single section of my thesis in the thesis folder.

I used market model, Kalman filter, ARIMA and ANN to analyze outliers and price abnormalities around outliers.

In academics simplier version of similar practices are known as event studies.

Special thanks to rpy2, Keras and pmd.arima authors.
