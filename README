Hello and welcome to my Github!

This is a page I created to present my thesis codes. In the files you will see the codes used in every single section of my thesis.
It is quite a long list of codes (xx lines) so I put the two applications which I find most interesting:

(1) Using Kalman Filter to estimate betas and calculate abnormal returns, which are then used to train a neural network
(2) Using ARIMA Monte Carlo simulations to simulate structural breaks and train neural networks
Are here.
