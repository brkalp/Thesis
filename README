Hello and welcome to my page!

This is a page I created to present my thesis codes. In the files you will see the codes used in every single section of my thesis in the thesis folder.
I used market model, Kalman filter, ARIMA and ANN to analyze outliers and price abnormalities around outliers.

In theory such practices are known as event studies.

It is quite a long list of codes so I put the code which I find most interesting out of the file:

  Using Kalman Filter to estimate betas and calculate abnormal returns, which are then used to train a neural network
  Network is trained to learn price patterns prior to M&A activities of large tech companies.

Special thanks to rpy2, Keras and pmd.arima authors.
