Research shows there are significant price differences prior to M&A activities.
Such price run-ups are allocated to insider trading and complex investors that were able to predict the events.

I got large tech companies and their merger activies from mrgr.com and calculate abnormal returns using the Kalman Filter.
Merger announcements are labeled and network is trained.
