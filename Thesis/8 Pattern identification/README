Instead of labeling and feeding the network returns,
I identify ARIMA models before and after the outliers, since they have different paramters, its Monte Carlo simulations are different.

I label with binary classification both MC simulations and train the network. Network is able to locate the outliers locations however calculating its accuracy is not an easy task.

rpy package, that enables me to use R codes in python, is used for MC simulations since arima codes in python do not generate MC paths.
