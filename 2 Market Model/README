To calculate abnormal returns, usual approach is to use the market model (CAPM/single index model)

Here I estimate Beta's and abnormal returns for different rolling windows, to show its importance as a parameter for this model.
Then abnormal returns for different windows are calculated and plotted with confidence intervals.
